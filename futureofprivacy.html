  <h3> <em> What's the future of privacy in a big data world? </em> </h3>
  <br> <br>
  <p>
  As technology continues to advance, the world continues to become less private.
  Whether it is something as general as CCTV cameras to keep an eye on the public
  or whether its something a lot more personal like being able to hack someones IP address and find out exactly what they have been doing on their PC,
  its becoming increasingly difficult for secrets... to remain secret.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Richard Clarke, a chairman and chief executive of a provider of cybersecurity services,
believes that privacy will only exist in the future for those who can afford it therefore he only sees the rich having it.
He then goes on to state that the storage of vast amounts of data has led to both hugely valuable benefits from analysis and correlation
as well as it a significant erosion, if not almost complete destruction, of any meaningful concept of privacy (Clark, 2014).
<br>
The CEO of facebook Mark Zuckerberg, believes the age of privacy is ‘over,’
and that norms have evolved considerably since he first co-founded the social networking site (Bosker, 2011).”
</p>
<br>
<p>
My personal opinion is that in terms of technology, there is no privacy for the future to look forward to.
Nowadays, every piece of technology from mobile phones to computurs and games consoles are being build with an alterior motive;
to monitor the users actions on it. No wonder we constantly hear in the news about violations of privacy.
If its not psn accounts being hacked on playstation then its celebrity nudes being leaked on Icloud.
To a certain degree I do agree with Richard Clarke's statement. I believe that privacy will become to expensive for the general public to afford
and it will only be able to be accessible to wealthy. But for us working class, if we want privacy then we better lock our doors,
close the curtains and revert back to a time with no access to a phone let alone the internet.
