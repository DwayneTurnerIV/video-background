  <h3>President Nixon Resigns: Watergate Scandal | Archives | TODAY</h3>
</br>
<p>On June 17, 1972, several people were caught on site of Democratic National Committee,
located in the Watergate building in Washington, D.C. and were arrested.
Now tresspassing would of be one thing that is viable for their arrests
but they had been attempting to wiretap phones and steal secret documents but what makes this story even more shocking
was that the burgulars were somehow connected to President Richard Nixon and his re-election campaign.
Now many expert historians are unsure whether Nixon actually knew about this undercover operation before it happened however,
he did not try to distance himself from the burglers as much as possible but he also when as far as to cover it up afterwards,
raising money for the criminals to keep them quiet, trying to stop the FBI from digging deeper into the scandal,
finding and destroying evidence as well as sacking staff members that were not co-operating.
Nixon's days were finally numbered in August 1974.
After his role in the Watergate conspiracy had finally come to light as well as other failures during his time in office
including the very controversial Vietnam war, the president resigned. Gerald Ford,
Nixon's eventual successor immediately pardoned Nixon for all the crimes he â€œmay or may not have committed."
Nixon was never prosecuted for the crimes he supposedly committed however,
the effects of the Watergate scandal had changed politics in America forever,
leading many Americans to doubt their leadership and become more judgemental about the presidency (Anon, 2009).</p> <br>

<p>This was regarded as one of the biggest political scandals in political history
which completely damaged President Nixon's reputation despite not being convicted of any of its crimes and infringements.
The watergate scandal was a huge breach of security as the criminals were found to be wiretapping the democratic house party
which was a clear violation of their privacy. The political affair wasnt made any more secret by the media
who blew this story wide open to the general public which didn't help Nixion in a multitude of ways.
For one, the media exposing Nixon showed that he as a leader could not be trusted as he was clearly abusing his powers as president.
However, in addition to this, it created various rumours and accusations that may or may not have been true under Nixon
but it didn't matter. The one thing that was guarenteed after the watergate scandel was that
Nixon had lost the faith of his fellow americans and could no longer continue to run the country.</p>
