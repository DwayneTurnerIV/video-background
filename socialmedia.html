<h3> SOCIAL MEDIA: A Loss of Privacy? </h3>

  <br> <br>
  <p>
  Social Media has been, for some time now, the go to place to connect with our friends and family online,
  share wonderful moments, play social games and just all in all have fun. But how private is the popular platform and is it as safe as it once was?
  Many social media sites such as facebook, twitter, tumblr etc. have continued to be under scrutiny over how safe their sites have been
  with many examples of controversy facing each one of them over their private settings.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
  Facebook: <br>
  Facebook has been scrutinized for a variety of privacy concerns due to changes in its privacy settings on the site
  generally over time as well as privacy concerns within Facebook applications.
  There have been many cases where facebook's privacy has been questioned and in some cases exposed as the shambles it has been over the past.
  Some of these include when Facebook had accidentally leaked 500 million Facebook users details to advertisers back in 2011,
  when Facebook offered developers access to users' addresses and phone numbers back in 2011 and finally
  in may 2010, due to a security flaw, it was possible for your friends to view your private chats (Love, 2013).
  These problems have since been rectified but it doesn't change the fact that our details and private life
  have been exposed to people we dont want to see it on more than one occassion.

  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
This was just one of the major social media websites with many others such as Twitter and Myspace who have had their fair share of
problems with privacy over the years. With technology rapidly advancing and more social media sites being created
it is only a matter of time before another accidental leakage of information or
a security flaw which allows public access to private messages or photos.
The fact is alot of these 'privacy issues' that social media have come across can and usually are prevented.
So why is it still a big issue among us social media users and have we come to the time where privacy online just doesn't exist?
